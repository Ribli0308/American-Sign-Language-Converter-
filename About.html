    <p class = "style">Communication is very crucial to human beings, as it enables us to express ourselves. However, unfortunately, for the speaking and hearing impaired people, there is a communication gap.</p>
    <p class = "style">Sign language is the mode of communication which uses visual ways like expressions, hand gestures to convey meaning. It is extremely helpful for people who face difficulty with hearing or speaking. </p>
    <p class = "style">Sign language recognition refers to the conversion of these gestures into words or alphabets of existing formally spoken languages. Thus, conversion of sign language into words by an algorithm or a model can help bridge the gap between people with hearing or speaking impairment and the rest of the world. </p>
    <p class = "style">The project aims at building a machine learning model that will be able to classify which letter of the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet is, given an image of a hand showing a sign. In this model, classification machine learning algorithms are trained using a set of image data and testing is done on a completely different set of data. Various machine learning algorithms are applied on the datasets, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The neural networks will recognize signed ASL letters using simple images of hands taken with a personal device such as a laptop webcam and translate them to english alphabets.</p>
    <p class = "style">We are further motivated by the isolation that is felt within the deaf community. Loneliness and depression exists in higher rates among the deaf population, especially when they are immersed in a hearing world. Some of the difficulties they face are information deprivation, limitation of social connections, and difficulty integrating in society. By using this sign language translator, they will be able to better communicate with others in day to day interactions.</p>
